# What-Should-I-Eat
This is more of a fun project and first thing I made using React. </br>
It is little variation of the todo-list I learned from a Udemy Course on React. </br>

With this application I got introduced with following tools/technologies - </br>
* React.js
* Babel
* Webpack
* ES6

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/devanSAGA/what-should-i-eat.git

npm install
npm run dev-server
```
